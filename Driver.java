/*
* Hello sir! I did this on my own >:)
* So no teammates and everything and this in order for me to practice for the final project
*
* Okay before compiling, sir, I would like to clarify that in NEO LMS Iacademy, Neo might rename Driver into Driver(1) or
* Driver(4) or something.
*
* Another thing to clarify is, id_purchase_history is changed to id_purchase_history
* purchasehistory is purchase_history since mysql is not case sensitive so I figured to put in a lined space between them
* Just so they can be easier to read.
*
* I used snake case for this, this is because I am not yet that familiar with SQL since I am only a first year
* student and haven't touched SQL yet. But I love a challenge! *picks up battleaxe
*
* And another clarification is the password: the password in SQL_SORTER class is 89antaraNus
 * So I am guessing you, sir, will change it.

    //Ala python LMAO

//Final thoughts before submission, final project is nearing. When submitted I would then try to add more functions
//in this activity thingy that will parse a JSON file. Over all this was a fun activity, going to submit this on March 30
//
//Note: In the final project, I will be using my virtual machine Windows 10 just so I can access Intellij and mySQL Workbench
//And as always Bella Ciao!
